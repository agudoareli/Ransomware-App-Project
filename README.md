# Ransomware-App-Project
 
Title: Ransomware Early Warning Signs App  
Description: Create an educational app that combines technical warning signs with real world spikes in public attention.  
I selected this project because small businesses that don't have a cybersecurity team may be unaware of the many ways they can get ransomware, the early warning signs, and early remediation. 
This matters in cybersecurity because ransomware attacks are very common and a lot of people do not know how to prevent it or treat it once it has happened. 
Others have already created ransomware protection apps that provide education and scans, but there does not seem to be an app that also provides public trends.  
I bring beginner cybersecurity knowledge on CVEs and coding experience.  
The new knowledge I will need is education on more ransomware attacks and names, and I will also need to learn how to code in a front-end language to create a UI. 
I hope to learn how to build an application from scratch and a lot of new knowledge on modern and common threats. 
 
Goal: By the end of the project, I hope to learn how to build interactive applications from scratch and also be more informed about current cybersecurity threats.  
The in-scope areas of my project include early warning signs of ransomware-related CVEs, early and late remediation techniques, and public trends on current similar threats. Out-of-scope would be anything that is more complex than this due to the timeline. 
The output I plan to produce is an interactive UI. 
My expected timeline is as follows: take the first 2 weeks to educate myself on the pseudocode, back-end and front-end languages, take the next month to develop my first draft, and take the last month to refine my first draft into the final one.
